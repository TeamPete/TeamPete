### :wave: Hi, I'm Peter!
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm passionate about data analysis and visualization, with a focus on leveraging Excel, SQL, and Tableau to extract insights and drive business decisions.

As a self-taught data enthusiast, I've honed my skills in data reporting, dashboard creation, and querying. I thrive on turning raw data into actionable insights, empowering teams to make informed decisions.

I am currently seeking entry-level opportunities as a Data/Business Analyst. I'm eager to apply my abilities to real-world challenges and contribute to the success of data-driven organizations.
